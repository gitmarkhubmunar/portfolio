# To-Do List
*Last updated: February 28, 2018*

This is a list of all to-do items remaining for backend development and deployment.

 * Test deployment on non-Ubuntu platforms.
 * Test `ssl-certificate.sh` on a fresh VM.
 * Add the dock app to the repository.
 * Decide what to do with the init script. Should we grab the latest copy on boot?
